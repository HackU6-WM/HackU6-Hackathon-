# HACKU6
## Domainion
We've created a web application through Django that will suggest domain names based on a user's search for the given domains: .boats, .homes, .motorcycles, .yachts, and .autos.

## Minimum Viable Product
We completed our MVP in the first day by returning a dictionary of possible domains related to the original search and the user's location.

## Additional Features
Return relevant or rhyming domains, return domains with common adjectives, return domains including user's location as well as a reference to their location on the home page, and returning domain availability.  Overall we return ~50 possible domains, or the maximum suggested amount if less.

## Future Goals:
Ability to purchase through the application, machine learning to determine domain popularity based on location, creating a Rest API associated with our service, an increated query rate through NameStudio, a user service to favorite or save domains someone is interested in, and the Ability to Cache responses to avoid repeated requests.
